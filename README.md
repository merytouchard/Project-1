Coinbase dominates the crypto space with its user friendly app 

The May of  2012 one of the biggest crypto exchanges was born, also known as Coinbase. Founded by Brian Armstrong & Fred Ehrsam when bitcoin was at 6 bucks the 2 launched Coinbase in their 2 bedroom condo. Armstrong’s vision of wanting “the world to have a global, open financial system that drove innovation & freedom.” lead him to create Coinbase named after “coinbase transactions, which are transactions that introduce crypto into proof of work cryptocurrencies. “ After enrolling in a startup incubator program Armstrong received $150k to launch Coinbase with the requirement of adding a co-founder to the team. Fred & Brian met online after Brian's post on reddit went viral, where he was actively seeking a co-founder to launch coinbase. 

Business Activities 

In the beginning the world of crypto can be overwhelming. What makes Coinbase successful is how easy the platform is for new users. Used by 98 million users internationally, it's a simple way to turn cash into crypto, “ Coinbase serves as a reliable bank for storing and safeguarding cryptocurrency assets. Users also rely on Coinbase to keep track of their portfolios, research different coins, and stay updated with the world of crypto.”

Recommendations 

Human connection is what the world of crypto is missing. If I were to advise coinbase I would recommend coinbase building a crypto coffee shop where free education is provided. Taking crypto from online to the physical realm would benefit the consumer because any questions a consumer has instead of getting confused online & reading a bunch of articles they can simply ask a human. The technology in the coffee shop would consist of accepting crypto payments via apple pay through a coinbase debit card. “In a world dominated by technology, it is essential to recognize the value of genuine human connection and actively cultivate it. By prioritizing face-to-face interactions, practicing empathy and active listening, and leveraging technology mindfully, we can create a more connected, compassionate, and fulfilling world.” Coinbase is the leader in crypto because of its simplicity.
